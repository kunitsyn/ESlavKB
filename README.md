# Eastern Slavic combined keyboard layout

This is a repository of creating custom keyboard layout for Windows that allows printing in Eastern Slavic languages (Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian). Since Eastern Slavic languages have almost, but not totally, identical alphabets, this can be a really useful thing for all people that use any of these languages simultaneously. In fact, it is so useful that I think it should have been in Windows by default.

The only file in the repository itself is a KLC file which is to be feed to [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339). But MS KLC is a pretty old, crummy tool, so you better save your time and jump straight to the [release page](https://github.com/kunitsyn/ESlavKB/releases), where you can find compiled binaries.

This layout is similar to [RUU keyboard layout](http://wiki.opennet.ru/RUU) that can be found in KDE4.
